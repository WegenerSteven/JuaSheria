## Problem

Kenya is experiencing a significant political awakening, particularly among Gen Z citizens who are actively challenging government actions they perceive as punitive, corrupt, and unaccountable. Current issues include:

- **Youth-Led Protests**: Gen Z Kenyans are rising against government policies, police brutality, and systemic corruption
- **Constitutional Ignorance**: Many protesters and citizens don't fully understand their constitutional rights and how to legally defend them
- **Government Accountability Crisis**: Citizens struggle to hold officials accountable due to lack of legal knowledge
- **Police Brutality**: Young people face harassment but don't know their legal protections and recourse options
- **Complex Legal Language**: Constitutional documents use technical language that's difficult for ordinary citizens and activists to understand
- **Limited Legal Literacy**: Many Kenyans, especially youth, lack resources to interpret legal documents during critical moments
- **Expensive Legal Consultation**: Getting legal guidance during protests or government encounters requires expensive lawyer consultations most cannot afford

**The Need for Constitutional Awareness**: As Kenyans continue to fight for justice, transparency, and accountability, there's an urgent need for citizens‚Äîespecially young activists‚Äîto understand their Constitution, know their rights, and learn how to defend them legally.

**JuaSheria** addresses this critical need by providing an intelligent, accessible AI assistant that can instantly interpret Kenyan legal documents, explain constitutional rights in simple terms, and help citizens understand how to legally protect themselves while fighting for change.
